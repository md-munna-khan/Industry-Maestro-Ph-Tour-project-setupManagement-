## 25-1 What is SDLC, How we should start a Project
- SDLC stands for Software Development Life Cycle. It is a structured process used by software developers and project managers to design, develop, test, and deploy high-quality software efficiently. and ast deploy and hand over to customer

The most popular SDLC project approaches used today, especially in modern software development, are:

- 🔥 1. Agile Model (Most Popular Today)
🔄 Key Features:
Iterative and incremental

Focus on collaboration, customer feedback, and rapid delivery

Divides the project into small cycles called sprints (usually 1–4 weeks)

Suitable for changing requirements

✅ Best For:
Startups, dynamic projects, web/mobile apps, frequent updates

🔧 Example:
A food delivery app is continuously improved based on user feedback after each sprint.

- 💧 2. Waterfall Model
📐 Key Features:
Sequential approach – one phase is completed before the next starts

Easy to understand and manage

No overlap between phases

❌ Limitation:
Not flexible to changes once the development starts

✅ Best For:
Well-defined, small to medium-sized projects with fixed requirements (e.g., government or defense systems)

- 🔁 3. Iterative Model
🔁 Key Features:
Starts with basic functionality, then adds features in cycles

Feedback after each iteration helps improve the next version

✅ Best For:
Projects where full requirements are not known upfront

💡 4. Spiral Model
🔄 Key Features:
Combines iterative development with risk analysis

Each phase involves risk assessment, planning, and testing

✅ Best For:
Large, complex, and high-risk projects (e.g., banking software)

- ✅ 5. DevOps Approach (Modern Practice)
🔧 Key Features:
Merges development and operations teams

Focuses on automation, continuous integration (CI), and continuous delivery (CD)

Fast and frequent deployments

✅ Best For:
Cloud-based apps, SaaS platforms, large-scale systems
